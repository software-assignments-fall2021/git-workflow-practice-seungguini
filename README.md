> From Natural Language to Code

The OpenAI, an AI research and development company, has recently published a version of **OpenAI Codex**, an AI system which "translates natural language to code". While the field of natural language processing has been rising in popularity in recent years, it's quite mindblowing to see a machine learning model that can write code itself. Though **OpenAI Codex** isn't 100% available to the public, I find it crazy that we're able to essentially write code which, in turn writes more code. Though the Matrix may not be imminent (yet), this does seem like another step towards machine domination...

Hi Seunggun! Have humans finally taught code how to write code itself? It feels like we may have... This is really interesting because NLP has always been crazy to me. Speaking and understanding a language is (in my opinion) the most specialized and complicated skill that humans have - it is amazing that we have taught computers to understand it (even in a small capacity) and that they are writing code now. Great article choice!
